# ANL 2026 League Tutorial

This document provides a quick tutorial to get you started in developing your agent for the [ANL 2026 League](https://anac.cs.brown.edu/anl).

The ANL 2026 competition challenges you to design and build a negotiation agent for bilateral negotiation that tries to hide its preferences from the opponent. The agent is rewarded for the agreement made in the negotiation, as well as for how well it is able to conceal its preferences. The challenge is to keep the opponent in the dark while maximizing reward. For more details, see the [CFP](https://anac.cs.brown.edu/files/anl/y2026/2026cfp.pdf) and the [Tutorial](https://anac.cs.brown.edu/files/anl/y2026/template2026.pdf).

A sample agent skeleton built with [NegMAS](https://github.com/yasserfarouk/negmas) can be downloaded [here](https://anac.cs.brown.edu/files/anl/y2026/anl2026.zip).

## Quick Start

1. **Register & Download:** Register at [ANL 2026](https://anac.cs.brown.edu/register) and download the skeleton ([details](#0-registration-and-download))
2. **Install dependencies:** `uv sync` ([details](#1-installation))
3. **Rename your agent:** Change `mynegotiator.py` to `your_agent.py` and `MyNegotiator` to `YourAgent` ([details](#2-getting-started-rename-your-agent))
4. **Implement your agent:** Edit your renamed file ([details](#3-implementing-your-agent), [examples](#example-agents))
5. **Test locally:** `anl2026 run` and `anl2026 tournament` ([details](#4-usage-from-the-command-line))
6. **Submit:** Zip and upload to the competition site ([details](#6-submission))

> [!TIP]
> You can also clone/download this repository directly from GitHub if you prefer using version control from the start.

## 1. Installation

### Using uv (Recommended)

First, install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if you do not have it:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c `
  "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Then install the project dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

To update NegMAS to the latest version:

```bash
uv sync --upgrade-package negmas
```

#### Switching Between PyPI and GitHub Versions of NegMAS

By default, the project uses the stable NegMAS release from PyPI. If you need the latest development version (e.g., for bug fixes not yet released), you can switch to the GitHub version:

1. **Edit `pyproject.toml`:**
   ```toml
   dependencies = [
       # "negmas>=0.15.4",  # Comment out this line
       "negmas @ git+https://github.com/yasserfarouk/negmas.git@main",  # Uncomment this line
       "typer>=0.15.0",
   ]
   ```

2. **Sync dependencies:**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

To switch back to the PyPI version, reverse the comments and run `uv sync` again.

> [!NOTE]
> For submissions, we recommend using the stable PyPI version unless instructed otherwise by the competition organizers.

### Using pip

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## 2. Getting Started: Rename Your Agent

Before you start developing, rename the agent module and class to match your submission name. This helps identify your agent in tournaments and is required for submission.

**Naming conventions:**

- **Module (file):** `snake_case` (e.g., `awesome.py`, `smart_negotiator.py`)
- **Class:** `TitleCase` (e.g., `AwesomeNegotiator`, `SmartNegotiator`)

### VS Code

1. **Rename the file:**

   - Right-click `mynegotiator.py` in the Explorer -> Rename
   - Enter your new name (e.g., `awsome.py`)

2. **Rename the class:**

   - Open the renamed file
   - Click on `MyNegotiator` class name
   - Press `F2` (or right-click -> Rename Symbol)
   - Enter your new class name (e.g., `AwesomeNegotiator`)

3. **Update references in `main.py`:**

   - Open `main.py`
   - Replace all occurrences of `mynegotiator` with your module name (e.g., `awesome`)
   - Replace all occurrences of `MyNegotiator` with your class name (e.g., `AwesomeNegotiator`)

### PyCharm

1. **Rename the file:**

   - Right-click `mynegotiator.py` in Project view -> Refactor -> Rename (or `Shift+F6`)
   - Enter your new name (e.g., `awesome.py`)
   - Check "Search for references" and "Search in comments and strings"

2. **Rename the class:**

   - Open the renamed file
   - Right-click on `MyNegotiator` -> Refactor -> Rename (or `Shift+F6`)
   - Enter your new class name (e.g., `AwesomeNegotiator`)
   - PyCharm will update all references automatically

3. **Verify imports in `main.py`** are updated correctly

### Vim/Neovim (with LSP)

1. **Rename the file** (Linux/macOS/Git Bash):
   ```bash
   mv ozu_negotiator.py awesome.py
   ```

   Or on Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell):
   ```cmd
   ren mynegotiator.py awesome.py
   ```

2. **Rename the class (using LSP rename):**

   - Open the file and place cursor on `MyNegotiator`
   - Use your LSP rename command (commonly `<leader>rn` or `:lua vim.lsp.buf.rename()`)
   - Enter the new name (e.g., `AwesomeNegotiator`)

3. **Update references in `main.py`:**

   - Replace all occurrences of `mynegotiator` with your module name (e.g., `awesome`)
   - Replace all occurrences of `MyNegotiator` with your class name (e.g., `AwesomeNegotiator`)

### Manual Renaming (Any Editor)

1. **Rename the file** (Linux/macOS/Git Bash):

   ```bash
   mv ozu_negotiator.py awesome.py
   ```

   Or on Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell):

   ```cmd
   ren mynegotiator.py awesome.py
   ```

2. **Edit the renamed file:**

   - Change `class MyNegotiator` to `class AwesomeNegotiator` (or your chosen name)

3. **Edit `main.py`:**

   - Replace all occurrences of `mynegotiator` with your module name (e.g., `awesome`)
   - Replace all occurrences of `MyNegotiator` with your class name (e.g., `AwesomeNegotiator`)

4. **Verify the changes:**
   ```bash
   anl2026 run
   ```

## 3. Implementing Your Agent

Your agent is implemented in your renamed module file. See the example agents below for different approaches to building agents.

### Example Agents

The `examples/` folder contains three example negotiator implementations that demonstrate different approaches to building agents:

#### BOANeg (`examples/boa.py`)

A modular agent using the **BOA (Bidding, Opponent modeling, Acceptance)** architecture. This architecture separates the negotiation strategy into three independent components:

- **Bidding Strategy:** Uses `TimeBasedOfferingPolicy` - makes concessions based on remaining time
- **Opponent Model:** Uses `GSmithFrequencyModel` - learns opponent preferences from their offers
- **Acceptance Strategy:** Uses `ACNext` - accepts if the offer is better than what we would offer next

You can test it with:

```bash
anl2026 run --opponent examples.boa.BOANeg
```

You can see all available components from negmas using:

```bash
python -c \
  "from negmas.registry import component_registry as CR; \
   print(CR.keys());"
```

#### MAPNeg (`examples/map.py`)

A **MAP (Maximum Aspiration Policy)** agent that also uses modular components but with a different base architecture allowing for multiple opponent models at once and other arbitrary components:

- Uses the same time-based offering and acceptance strategies as BOANeg
- Supports multiple opponent models (configured with `GSmithFrequencyModel`)
- Processes acceptance before offering (`acceptance_first=True`)

```bash
anl2026 run --opponent examples.map.MAPNeg
```

#### SimpleNegotiator (`examples/simple.py`)

A minimal agent implemented in a single function, demonstrating the basics of negotiation:

- **Opponent Model:** Assumes the opponent's utility is the inverse of ours
- **Acceptance:** Accepts any offer with utility >= 0.8
- **Offering:** Proposes random outcomes with utility between 1.0-relative_time and 1.0

This is a good starting point to understand the negotiation API before moving to more complex architectures.

```bash
anl2026 run --opponent examples.simple.SimpleNegotiator
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can base your agent on any supported NegMAS negotiator (For some examples check [this](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/negotiators.html) list. Other agents are available through [negmas-negobog](https://autoneg.github.io/negmas-negolog/) and [negmas-geniusweb-bridge](https://autoneg.github.io/negmas-geniusweb-bridge/)). You can explore available negotiators, their behavior, etc in the [NegMAS GUI](https://autoneg.github.io/negmas-app/).


## 4. Usage from the command line

> **Note:** All commands below work on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

> **Important:** Before running any commands, ensure your virtual environment is activated:
> - **If installed with uv:** Either activate the venv (see below), OR prefix commands with `uv run` (e.g., `uv run anl2026 run`)
>   - Linux/macOS/Git Bash: `source .venv/bin/activate`
>   - Windows (Command Prompt): `.venv\Scripts\activate`
>   - Windows (PowerShell): `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
> - **If installed with pip:** Activate the venv (same commands as above)

### Running a single negotiation

To run a single negotiation:

```bash
anl2026 run
```

This will run your agent against a random opponent on a random scenario and report:
- **Advantage:** utility - reserved-value
- **Concealing:** How well you hide your preferences from your opponent's model of you
- **Score:** The final ANL 2026 score

#### Run command options

2. Install the recommended Python extension
3. Select the Python interpreter from `.venv`:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS)
   - Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
   - Choose from `.venv/bin/python` or `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`
4. Edit your agent file (renamed from `mynegotiator.py`) to implement your agent
5. Run tests with `pytest` in the integrated terminal
6. Run your agent with `anl2026 run`

### Vim/Neovim

1. Ensure you have a Python LSP configured (e.g., pyright, pylsp)
2. Activate the virtual environment or use `uv run` prefix for commands
3. Edit your agent file (renamed from `mynegotiator.py`) to implement your agent
4. Run commands from the terminal:
   ```bash
   anl2026 run
   pytest
   ```

### PyCharm / Other IDEs

1. Open the project folder
2. Configure the Python interpreter to use `.venv`:
   - Go to Settings/Preferences > Project > Python Interpreter
   - Add from `.venv/bin/python` or `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`
3. Edit your agent file (renamed from `mynegotiator.py`)
4. Use the built-in terminal to run:
   ```bash
   anl2026 run
   pytest
   ```

## 6. Submission

<!-- SUBMISSION_START -->
To submit your agent to the ANL 2026 competition:

1. Ensure your renamed your agent and followed the instruction for development and have a runnable agent. To test that you have a runnable agent, use:

  ```bash
  anl2026 run
  ```

and

  ```bash
  anl2026 tournament
  ```

2. Test your agent locally using `anl2026 run` and `anl2026 tournament`
3. Add any extra dependencies you need for your agent in requirements.txt. Try to always use the most recent version of each library to maximize the re-usability of your agent in the future.
4. Create your submission zip file:

   **Using the provided scripts (recommended for all platforms):**

   Linux/macOS/Git Bash:
   ```bash
   ./make_submission.sh
   ```

   Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):
   ```cmd
   make_submission.bat
   ```

   > **Note:** The Windows script requires PowerShell, which is included by default in Windows 7 and later.

   Both scripts will:

   - Create `submission.zip` in your project root
   - Include all necessary files (your renamed negotiator, requirements.txt, any additional Python/data files)
   - Exclude development files, examples, tests, and configuration files
   - Show the contents of the created zip file

   **Or manually:**

   Linux/macOS/Git Bash:

   ```bash
   zip -r submission.zip . \
     -x ".*" \
     -x ".git/*" \
     -x ".venv/*" \
     -x "examples/*" \
     -x "scenarios/*" \
     -x "report/*" \
     -x "tests/*"
   ```

   Windows (Command Prompt with tar):

   ```cmd
   tar -a -cf submission.zip ^
     --exclude=.* ^
     --exclude=.git ^
     --exclude=.venv ^
     --exclude=examples ^
     --exclude=scenarios ^
     --exclude=report ^
     --exclude=tests ^
     .

    You can use any app to generate this zip file but, remember to exclude all folders
    starting with "." (e.g. .git, .venv), and the scenarios, report and tests folders to
    avoid exceeding the submission size limit. These are not needed in your submission
    anyway.

5. Submit your agent following the competition guidelines at [ANL 2026 Competition Page](https://anac.cs.brown.edu/anl)

   5.1. [First time] Register for the competition [here](https://anac.cs.brown.edu/register)

   5.2. Login for the submission site [here](https://anac.cs.brown.edu/login)

   5.3. Go to your home page "Your Home" and choose "Submissions"

   5.4. Under "ANL", click "New Agent" and fill the form. Example assuming your agent class is `AwsomeNegotiator` in `awsome.py`:

     - **Agent Name:** Awsome Negotiator
     - **Agent Alias:** Awsome Negotiator
     - **Agent Module:** awsome
     - **Agent Class:** AwsomeNegotiator
     - **Dependencies:** Any packages you installed via `pip install` or `uv add` (semicolon-separated, no spaces)
     - **Code:** submission.zip
     - **Requirements File:** requirements.txt
     - **Report:** Upload your report PDF (required for final submission only; drafts can be submitted anytime)

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you need data files (e.g., trained models), ensure they're in your submission zip. See [Accessing Data Files](https://scml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#how-can-i-access-a-data-file-in-my-package) for details (written for SCML but process is identical).

You can submit your agent multiple times before the deadline. Submit early and frequently! We test submissions and provide feedback on failures. Track your progress on the [leaderboard](https://anac.cs.brown.edu/leaderboard).

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Clearing Python Cache

If you're experiencing unexpected behavior after modifying your code (e.g., old code still running), Python's bytecode cache (`.pyc` files) may be stale. Clear the cache with:

**Linux/macOS/Git Bash:**
```bash
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
find . -type f -name "*.pyc" -delete 2>/dev/null
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Directory -Filter "__pycache__" | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter "*.pyc" | Remove-Item -Force
```

### Reinstalling Dependencies

If you're having issues with dependencies or want to ensure a clean environment:

**Using uv (Recommended):**
```bash
# Remove the virtual environment and reinstall everything
rm -rf .venv  # Linux/macOS/Git Bash
# OR on Windows: rmdir /s /q .venv

# Recreate and sync
uv sync
```

**Using pip:**
```bash
# Remove and recreate the virtual environment
rm -rf .venv  # Linux/macOS/Git Bash
# OR on Windows: rmdir /s /q .venv

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS/Git Bash
# OR on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -e .
```

### Reinstalling the anl2026 Command

If the `anl2026` command is not working correctly or running outdated code:

**Using uv:**
```bash
# Reinstall the package (this also reinstalls the CLI command)
uv sync --reinstall-package anl2026
```

**Using pip:**
```bash
# Reinstall in editable mode
pip install -e . --force-reinstall --no-deps
```

If the command still doesn't work, verify it's pointing to the correct location:

```bash
# Check where the command is installed
which anl2026  # Linux/macOS/Git Bash
# OR on Windows: where anl2026

# Verify the Python environment
anl2026 --help
```

> [!TIP]
> If you have multiple Python environments, make sure your virtual environment is activated before running `anl2026`. You can also use `uv run anl2026` to ensure the correct environment is used.
